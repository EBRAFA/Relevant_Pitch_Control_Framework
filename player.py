class player(object):
    """
    player() class

    Class defining a player object that stores position, velocity, time-to-intercept and pitch control contributions for a player

    __init__ Parameters
    -----------
    pid: id (jersey number) of player
    team: row of tracking data for team
    teamname: team name "Home" or "Away"
    params: Dictionary of model parameters (default model parameters can be generated using default_model_params() )

    methods include:
    -----------
    simple_time_to_intercept(r_final): time take for player to get to target position (r_final) given current position
    probability_intercept_ball(T): probability player will have controlled ball at time T given their expected time_to_intercept
